## **Notes**  

- **Case Sensitivity**:  
  Website names are case-sensitive. For example, "Facebook" and "facebook" are treated as different entries.  

- **Security Reminder**:  
  This program stores passwords in plain text. For enhanced security, it is strongly recommended to use encryption software to protect your stored credentials. Leaving passwords unencrypted can pose significant security risks.
